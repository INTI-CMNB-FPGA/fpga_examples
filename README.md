# FPGA examples

This project is about FPGA hard blocks and board features. Examples ready to use and verified in hardware. The prefered HDL language is VHDL.

This project is mainly developed and mantained by the *FPGA team* of the *Centre of Nano and Microelectronics* [CMNB](http://www.inti.gob.ar/microynanoelectronica/) of the *National Institute of Industrial Technology* [INTI](http://www.inti.gob.ar/). Contributions are welcome.

## Project Organization

Root directory:
* README.md: this file.
* LICENSE: of the project.
* CONTRIBUTORS.md: list of people who contributed to the project.
* docs/: documentation of the project.
* fpga_lib/: git submodule [fpga_lib](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB-FPGA/fpga_lib).
* synthesis/: shared TCL files to do synthesis. Generated by fpga_helpers.
* examples/: where the examples lives!

example directory:
* README.md: list of available examples.
* Several *vendor_board* sub directories.

*vendor_board* directories:
* README.md: general information about features, Power Supply and Programming Options.
* Directories with examples for the given board.
* resources: where to put how to obtain vendors files.

Examples directories:
* README.md: tutorial about how to run and reproduce the example.
* top.vhdl: top level.
* wrapper.vhdl [optional]: a wrapper for resources when complex, to have a cleanest top level.
* Makefile: generated by fpga_helpers to run synthesis and implementation.
* options.tcl: generated by fpga_helpers and customized by the user.
* Constraint file such as <board.ext>.
* testbench [optional]: only provided when useful (no trivial such as gpios) or posible (no license problems).

testbench directories:
* top_tb.vhdl: test or at least stimulus to see waveforms.
* Makefile: to run the test and see waveforms.
* files.<ext>: the files of the project.
* waves.<ext>: waveform to visualize.
