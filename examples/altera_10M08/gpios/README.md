# Description

This example shows how to use DIP switches and LEDs.
* 5 DIP switches drives the 5 LEDs.

# How to run synthesis, implementation and programming

* A free Quartus license is enough for the used FPGA (this example uses Quartus2 15.0).
* Prepare the environment to use Quartus.
* Run synthesis, implementation and bitstream generation:
```
$ make run
```
* Run programing (or use Quartus):
```
$ make prog
```

# How to test on hardware

* Change DIP switches to see how the LEDs changes its state.
