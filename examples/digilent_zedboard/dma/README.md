# Description

Example about how to use AXI DMA in Simple Mode.

In Simple Mode, it writes to AXI DMA the max. quantity of samples of 32 bits (2M-1), reads data back from AXI DMA and compares.

# How to run synthesis, implementation and programming

* For the used FPGA, Vivado Webpack can be used.
* Prepare the environment to use Vivado. For example, run:
```
$ . /PATH_TO_VIVADO/settings64.sh
```
* Open Vivado and create a new proyect for: ZedBoard.
* In Tcl Console, run (block designs generated with Vivado 2018.2):
  * For Simple Mode: `source <PATH>/simple.tcl`
* Rigth click in Sources -> Design Sources -> design_1 and Create HDL Wrapper.
* Generate Bitstream.
* File -> Export -> Export Hardware (include bitstream)
* Launch SDK
* Generate a new Application Project:
  * OS Platform: standalone
  * Template: Hello World
* Replace `helloworld.c` content with code from:
  * Simple Mode by Polling: `<ROOT>/shared/zynq7000/dma_simple_polling.c`
  * Simple Mode by Interrupts: `<ROOT>/shared/zynq7000/dma_simple_interrupt.c`
* Transfer the bitstream to the FPGA.
* Configure SDK terminal (or another terminal program) with the needed Port to see UART Output.
* Rigth Click over polled project -> Run As -> Launch on hardware.

# How to test on hardware

See results in the serial terminal.
