# Description

This example shows how to use DIP switches, push-buttons and LEDs.
* 4 DIP switches and 4 push-buttons drives 4 LEDS.
* This example do not use the PS part (Zynq), only PL.

# How to run synthesis, implementation and programming

* Use files to do a Vivado or ISE project.
* A valid license is needed.

# How to test on hardware

* Change SW12.1..4 to see how GPIO LEDs change its state.
* Hold SW7, 8, 9 y 13 to see how GPIO LEDs change its state.
